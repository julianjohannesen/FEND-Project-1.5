# Pixel Art Maker Project

The Pixel Art Maker was the final project in Udacity's Grow with Google Front-End Developement for Beginners course. Each student in the course was provided with some basic html and css and asked to code an application that will allow the user to draw in a color of their choosing on a grid created by an html table.

Randome notes:
-- Try using table.insertRow and row.insertCell in the vanilla js version
-- User DOMContentLoaded to ensure DOM loads first

```javascript
<script>
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function(event) {
    console.log("DOM fully loaded and parsed");
  });
</script>
```
