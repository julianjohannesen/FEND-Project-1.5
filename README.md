# Pixel Art Maker Project

The Pixel Art Maker was the final project in Udacity's Grow with Google Front End Scholarship Challenge. Each student in the course was provided with some basic html and css and asked to code an application that will allow the user to draw in a color of their choosing on a grid with dimensions of their choosing.

Please refer to the issues tab of the GitHub repo for more information on forthcoming improvements.
